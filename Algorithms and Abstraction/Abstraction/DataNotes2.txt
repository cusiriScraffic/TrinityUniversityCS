Abstraction Mechanisms
- Container -> An object holding a collection of elements therefore something like a vector is a container
One problem is that it allocates elements using ‘new’ but never deallocates them. C++ does define an interface for a garbage collector, it is not guaranteed for freeing memory therefore we use a destructor delete[] name of a destructor is ~ followed by a class e.g  ̃Vector() { delete[] elem; }  Handle-to-data model
- The technique of acquiring resources in a constructor and releasing them in a destructor, known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII
- The word virtual means ‘‘may be redefined later in a class derived from this one.
A class with a pure virtual function is called an abstract class.  

- Copying of an object of a class is defined by two members: a copy constructor and a copy assignment:
The name this is predefined in a member function and points to the object for which the member function is called.

Move Constructor &&… The && means ‘‘rvalue reference’’ and is a reference to which we can bind an rvalue (§6.4.1). The word ‘‘rvalue’’ is intended to complement ‘‘lvalue,’’ which roughly means ‘‘something that can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.’

Templets 
A template is a class or a function that we parameterize with a set of types or values.

Points, how they work and the syntax associated 
// stack and the heap. get memory from heap using new not malloc
ArrayStack<T>: public Stack<T>

it needs to store and array that is dynamically allocated


Queue —> ArrayQueue<T>
T* container
int size // capacity 
// We will need a front and back
int front 
int back // When back reaches the end you can wrap it around to the front of the queue
new index will be back = (back +1)% capacity and when they touch you know its full

can output user-defined types by overloading operators<< ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Vector& v) {
for(i = 0; i< v.size(); ++i ){
os << v[i] << ‘\n’}
}

Iterators // read on iterators

Vectors
v.at(3) is a range checking


Array based list
 insert
- check if its full, if so grow the array
if not for loop should go from right to left for(; ; —-) instead of ++ 

remove
from left to right 


Still storing dynamically array but more operations are allowed eg insert into an idea or delete from an index and shifting.

Iterator is doing the function of a pointers -> being able to point to a certain element within your array list and allow it to do for loops;; How to implement iterator - > it is a class inside an array. In the iterator you only need to store the current location/ address to where the iterator is pointing to. Just do operations on the pointers
